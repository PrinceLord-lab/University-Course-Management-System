# How to Help with This Project

Hey! If you want to contribute, here’s how:

## Branches
- `main`: The main branch (don’t touch this directly!).
- `develop`: Where we merge stuff.
- `feature/[name]`: Use this for new features (e.g., `feature/course-management`).

## Commits
- Write clear messages like: `feat: Add course management` or `fix: Fix login bug`.

## Pull Requests
1. Create a PR from your branch to `develop`.
2. Use the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Conflicts
- If there’s a conflict, rebase your branch with `develop` and fix it.
