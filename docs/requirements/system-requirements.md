## 📖 1. Introduction  
### 1.1 Purpose  
The University Course Management System aims to modernize the management of courses, student enrollments, faculty assignments, and grading. It provides an intuitive platform for administrators, faculty, and students to interact with academic records efficiently.  

### 1.2 Scope  
This system will support:  
- Course management (add, edit, delete courses)  
- Student and faculty management  
- Grade recording and computation  
- Reporting system for grades, class lists, and faculty loads  
- Basic authentication system for users

## 🔧 2. Functional Requirements  
The system must:  
1. Allow **administrators** to manage course offerings and user roles.  
2. Enable **students** to enroll in courses and view their grades.  
3. Provide **faculty** with tools to assign grades and manage course materials.  
4. Implement **authentication and access control** for users.  
5. Generate **reports** (grades, class lists, faculty assignments).
